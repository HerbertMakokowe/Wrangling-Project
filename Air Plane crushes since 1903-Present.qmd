# I inspected the dataset’s columns, basic statistics, and data types.There are issues such as inconsistent formatting, missing values, and incorrect data types that need cleaning. Understanding the structure and quality of the data helps identify what needs cleaning before meaningful analysis.

```{python}
data.columns

data.describe(include='all')

data.info()
```

# The Code below is trying to address the questions below.

# 1) How have plane crashes changed over time?
# 2) How have fatalities per year changed over time?
# 3) How deadly are crashes in terms of survival outcomes?
# 4) Which operators have caused the highest number of fatalities?
# 5) What are the overall characteristics of global plane crashes?


# Data Cleaning Process, several column names contained spaces and non-standard characters. Clean, standardized column names prevent errors and make coding easier.

```{python}
data.columns = (data.columns.str.strip().str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_').str.replace('#', 'number').str.replace('/', '_'))
```


# After data cleaning, Some dates were invalid or missing, but most converted correctly. Accurate dates are needed to analyze crash trends over time

```{python}
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'], errors='coerce')

data.columns
```

# Mathematical operations like totals and averages cannot be computed unless data is numeric thus we need to Convert categorical columns to numeric columns.


```{python}
num_cols = [
    'aboard',
    'aboard_passangers',
    'aboard_crew',
    'fatalities',
    'fatalities_passangers',
    'fatalities_crew',
    'ground'
]


for col in num_cols: data[col] = pd.to_numeric(data[col], errors='coerce')
```



# Creating time based features because the dataset spans more than 100 years of aviation history

```{python}
data['year'] = data['Date'].dt.year
data['month'] = data['Date'].dt.month
data['day_of_week'] = data['Date'].dt.day_name()
data['decade'] = (data['year'] // 10) * 10
```

# Below we create new columns.Many routes include both takeoff and landing points. This helps understand global crash distribution and flight patterns.

# Where were these planes going? 

```{python}
data[['origin', 'destination']] = data['route'].str.split('-', n=1, expand=True)
```

# Now we create Survival rate column

```{python}
data['survival_rate'] = data['aboard'] - data['fatalities']
data.loc[data['aboard'] <=0, 'survival_rate'] = None
```

# Survival category

```{python}
def classify(row):
    if pd.isna(row['survival_rate']):
        return "Unknown"
    if row['survival_rate'] == 0:
        return "No survivors"
    if row['survival_rate'] == 1:
        return "All survived"
    return "Some survived"

data['survival_category'] = data.apply(classify, axis=1)
```


# Computed summary statistics such as crashes per year, fatalities per year, operator totals, and survival categories. Certain decades show spikes, some operators have long histories of fatal accidents, and survival outcomes vary greatly. These metrics summarize the global crash landscape and form the foundation for deeper analysis.

```{python}
crashes_per_year = data.groupby('year').size()

fatalities_per_year = data.groupby('year')['fatalities'].sum()

operator_counts = data['operator'].value_counts()

deadliest_operators = data.groupby('operator')['fatalities'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)

data['fatalities_per_crash'] = data['fatalities']

survival_distribution = data['survival_category'].value_counts()

```

# VISUALIZATIONS

# a) Crashes Per Year

# From the figure we see fatalities follow a similar decline as crash counts but show spikes linked to major accidents.This reveals changes in aviation safety affecting human lives.

```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
crashes_per_year.plot()
plt.title("Crashes Per Year")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Number of Crashes")
plt.show()
```

# b) Fatalities Per Year

# Fatalities follow a similar decline as crash counts but show spikes linked to major. This reveals changes in aviation safety affecting human lives.

```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
fatalities_per_year.plot(color='red')
plt.title("Fatalities Per Year")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Total Fatalities")
plt.show()
```

# c) Survival Categories

# Visualized how crashes break down by survival category. Most fatal crashes result in “No survivors,” though a notable number involve partial survival.

```{python}
data['survival_category'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title("Crash Survival Outcomes")
plt.ylabel("Number of Crashes")
plt.xticks(rotation=360, ha='right')
plt.show()
```

# d) Top 10 Deadliest Operators

# The distribution below show that small number of operators account for a high number of deaths which is good if we are to see the historical patterns in airline safety and potential areas for investigation.

```{python}
deadliest_operators.head(5).plot(kind='bar', figsize=(8,6))
plt.title("Top 10 Deadliest Operators")
plt.ylabel("Total Fatalities")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right', fontsize=8)
plt.show()

```


# Summary Statistics


```{python}
total_crashes = len(data)
total_fatalities = data['fatalities'].sum()
avg_fatalities_per_crash = data['fatalities'].mean()

crashes_2000_onward = data[data['year'] >= 2000].shape[0]
